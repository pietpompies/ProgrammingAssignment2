## This function will create a special matrix, which is really a list containing a function to
##     set the value of the matrix
##     get the value of the matrix
##     set the value of the inverse
##     get the value of the inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
